google-cloud-logging Puppet Module

This Puppet Module installs package for Google Cloud Logging and starts the agent (google-fluentd).

This Puppet Module does the following:

Configures the required apt or yum repository. The environment variable REPO_SUFFIX can be set to alter which repository is used. A dash (-) will be inserted prior to the supplied suffix. Example values are 'unstable' or '20151027-1'.
Installs the logging agent.
Installs "catch-all" configuration files (unless the environment variable DO_NOT_INSTALL_CATCH_ALL_CONFIG is set to suppress this.)
Starts the logging agent.
Sends a test message which should be visible in the log viewer.
Google Cloud Logging collects and stores logs from applications and services on the Google Cloud Platform:

View your logs with the Logs Viewer, including third-party logs from your virtual machine instances.
Export your logs to Google Cloud Storage, Google BigQuery, or Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
